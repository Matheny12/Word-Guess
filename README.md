# Word-Guess

This is a 2 player game where one player puts a word and the other player has to guess the word. The amount of guesses is based on how many letters long the word is.

The code is different between Linux and Windows so make sure to select your correct system.

You will have to use "g++ *.cpp -o WordGuess" to compile, then "./WordGuess" to run.
